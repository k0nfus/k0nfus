# Hi, my name is Jan

I live close to Karlsruhe, Germany and love coding Apps.

## Interests

Currently I'm diving deeper into React because I totally enjoy creating beautiful Frontends for Desktop and/or Mobile on top of my (Django) REST APIs. That's how I actually solve problems in my reality.

## Operating System

Since I'm a huge fan of open source, I code most of the time in a Linux Distribution (like in example Debian, Kubuntu, ubuntu studio). But Windows and Mac are also a thing. Personally I prefer KDE over Gnome. But both are working fine for me in the end. As long as I can keep coding and learning awesome stuff.

## And there is chess

Passionate and always in the mood for a quick blunder: feel free to challenge me on chess.com or lichess.org.
